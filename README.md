# Portal Bruteforce Attack

**WARNING: This project is for educational and research purposes only. Do NOT use this tool against any real-life portal, website, or system without explicit permission. Unauthorized use may be illegal and unethical.**

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple brute-force attack technique on a web portal using JavaScript and HTML. The main objective is to identify users whose password is the same as their username, which can occur if users do not change their default password. This helps illustrate a common security risk and promotes better password practices.

## Features
- Basic HTML and JavaScript implementation
- Simulates brute-force attempts on a login form

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:albinjoby/Portal-Bruteforce-Attack.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Open the browser's Developer Tools (usually F12 or right-click > Inspect) and go to the Console tab.
4. (Optional) Type `// allow pasting` in the console to indicate you are about to paste code.
5. Copy the contents of `script.js` and paste it into the console.
6. Press Enter to execute the code and simulate the brute-force attack.
7. Observe the results in the browser and console.
